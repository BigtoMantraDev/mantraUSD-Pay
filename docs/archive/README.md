# Documentation Archive

This directory contains the original documentation files that have been consolidated into the new structure.

## What Happened?

As of January 2026, the documentation was restructured into two clear sections:

1. **Agent Codex** (`/docs/agents/`) - For LLM agents, verbose and rule-heavy
2. **Developer Handbook** (`/docs/dev/`) - For human developers, concise and architectural

## Archived Files

The following files have been merged into the new documentation:

### Merged into `/docs/agents/MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `OMIES_AGENT_RULES.md` - Original agent instructions

## Why Archive?

These files are kept for historical reference but should NOT be used for new development. Always refer to the current documentation structure:

- **For LLMs:** `/docs/agents/`
- **For Humans:** `/docs/dev/`

## Need Something?

If you need information from these archived files, check the new documentation first. The content has been reorganized and improved, not lost.
